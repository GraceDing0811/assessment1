# Global Access to Energy Over Time

## Data file
The data set I use in my analysis is about the number of people with and without energy access all over the world in 30 years.
You can access the data set through this link: 
https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021)/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021).csv

## What the project does
This project firstly introduces the information about the data set, including its structure, format and variables' descriptive statistics like their mean, standard deviation and range. Missing values proportion is also demonstrated.
Secondly, the project does three data wrangling based on the 'energy access' dataset, which are rename Variables, set Implausible Values into NA and select Columns.
Thirdly, the project visualizes the 'energy access' data thorugh: bar plots, line graphs and a scatter plot.
Finally, the project evaluates my interaction with Chatgpt 3.5, and comments on Chatgpt's code are indicated in a comparison to my code.
This project is useful in studies in social science field to understand countries' development and their population's well-being over time.

## How to get started with the project
1. Look at what the data set is about and look through my project's overview to see if this project is useful to you.
2. Several packages you may install (if you have not) which are used in my project: pacman, kableExtra, flextable, dplyr, ggplot2, purrr, tidyr, glue, janitor

## Where to get help with my project
You can use the error-check tools in R or put your question in Google.

## Project status
This project has stopped completely, you can reproduce a project or research rather than join my project.
