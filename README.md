# Global Access to Energy Over Time

## Data file
The data set I use in my analysis is about the number of people with and without energy access all over the world in 30 years.
You can access the data set through this link: 
https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021)/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021).csv

## R Packages 
In my report project, several packages are needed: pacman, kableExtra, flextable, dplyr, ggplot2, purrr, tidyr, glue, janitor.
You can install these packages in R if you have not done that.

## What the project does
This project firstly introduces the information about the data set, including its structure, format and variables' descriptive statistics like their mean, standard deviation and range. Missing values proportion is also demonstrated.

Secondly, the project does three data wrangling based on the 'energy access' dataset, which are rename Variables, set Implausible Values into NA and select Columns.

Thirdly, the project visualizes the 'energy access' data thorugh: bar plots, line graphs and a scatter plot.

Finally, the project evaluates my interaction with Chatgpt 3.5, and comments on Chatgpt's code are indicated in a comparison to my code.
