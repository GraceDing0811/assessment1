# Global Access to Energy Over Time

## Data file
The data set I use in my analysis is about the number of people with and without energy access all over the world in 30 years.
You can access the data set through this link:

## R Packages 
In my report project, several packages are needed: pacman, kableExtra, flextable, dplyr, ggplot2, purrr, tidyr, glue, janitor.
You can install these packages in R if you have not done that.
